In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-10-21\\nTitle: Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval\\nAuthors: Felix Michalak, Steven Abreu\\nSummary: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer\\narchitectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across\\nRecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic\\nretrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory\\nmechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to\\njust 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU\\nperformance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval\\ntasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle\\ntokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be\\navailable during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization\\nchallenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests\\nthese models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,\\nwith immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-03-02\\nTitle: Methods used in nanostructure modeling\\nAuthors: I.

              "'Page: Attention Is All You Need\\nSummary: \"Attention Is All You Need\" is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, and a main contributor to the AI boom, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of a wide variety of AI, such as large language models. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers franchise. The team was named Team Transformer.\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.\\nAs of 2025, the paper has been cited more than 173,000 times, placing it among the top ten most-cited papers of the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Kill\\nSummary: All You Need Is Kill is a Japanese science fiction light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka with illustrations by Yoshitoshi Abe. The book was published in Japanese by Shueisha under their Super Dash Bunko imprint in December 2004, and was later released in English by Viz Media under their Haikasoru imprint. All You Need Is Kill follows a soldier named Keiji Kiriya, who, after dying in a battle with extraterrestrials, is caught in a time loop that makes him live the same day repeatedly, allowing Kiriya to improve his fighting skills.\\nA manga adaptation, written by Ryosuke Takeuchi and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha\\'s Weekly Young Jump magazine between January and May 2014 and was also published by Viz Media in its Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. In November 2014, the Viz translation was released in a collected edition that included the entire series. A separate graphic novel adaptation, written by Nick Mamatas and illustrated by Lee Ferguson, was released in North America in May 2014. A live-action film adaptation from director Doug Liman starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, titled Edge of Tomorrow, was released in May 2014. The English-language film tie-in edition of the novel also uses this title. An anime film adaptation produced by Studio 4°C will be released in Japan in January 2026.\\nThe novel was Sakurazaka\\'s breakthrough science fiction novel, earning wide praise from fellow novelists including Yasutaka Tsutsui and Chōhei Kanbayashi and was entered in contention for the Best Japanese Long Work in the 36th Seiun Awards in 2005.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Death\\nSummary: All You Need Is Death is a 2023 Irish horror film, written and directed by Paul Duane in his dramatic feature debut. It concerns a pair of ethnomusicologists who unethically record a recital of an ancient song, thereby inciting the negative attentions of supernatural forces. It was made on a shoestring budget initially entirely funded by the director, and featured largely unknown actors with the exceptions of Olwen Fouéré and Gary Whelan.\\nAll You Need Is Death was released in a series of film festivals beginning in October 2023, and had its general release in the United States, Ireland and the United Kingdom the following April before being made available on stream'"

Instead, these systems learn patterns and make decisions based on data. Key aspects include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Learning from Data**: ML algorithms improve their performance as they are exposed to more data over time. For example, a spam filter becomes better at identifying spam emails as it processes more examples.\n",

            "2. **Types of Learning**:\n",
            "   - **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location).\n",
            "   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).\n",
            "   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards (e.g., training a robot to walk).\n",
